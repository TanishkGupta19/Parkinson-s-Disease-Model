Parkinson's Disease Diagnostic Model Using Machine Learning

Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disorder that affects the nervous system and the parts of the body controlled by the nerves.
Symptoms are also not that sound to be noticeable. Signs of stiffening, tremors, and slowing of movements may be signs of Parkinson’s disease.
But there is no ascertain way to tell whether a person has Parkinson’s disease or not because there are no such diagnostics methods available to diagnose this disorder.
So, the Idea of the Project what if we use machine learning to predict whether a person suffers from Parkinson’s disease or not and  This is exactly what we’ll be learning in this project.
